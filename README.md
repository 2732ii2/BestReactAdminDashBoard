The live hosted link  was : ` https://2732ii2.github.io/BestReactAdminDashBoard/ `.

The way i approached to the task is basically :
  
  -The most important think inside this project is how we make a chart or graph inside component 
  -And after that the most difficult and important
        - Make a positioning of div's in which it's work beautifully that mentioned inside the Figma
        So basically if we have a good understanding of Positing in CSS then it easy to make it.
   - And every thing is just React component's we have to use
   
   - Last but not least a Flexbox properties of CSS .
  
 That's all from my side.
